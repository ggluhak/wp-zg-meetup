# WordPress Zagreb Meetup

This repository contains presentations of the previous talks and a talk submission template.

The idea came from [zgphp](https://github.com/zgphp/zgphp-meetup-talks), where they wanted to simplify the talk submission process.

# Submit a talk

You have an awesome idea you would like to talk about? You worked on a project and learned some cool things you would like to share with the community? This is the place for you.

Sumbmission process is super easy:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch that looks like `your-name--talk-title` (e.g. `ivan-horvat--gutenberg-and-you`)
3. Copy the [talk-description-template.md](https://github.com/wpcroatia/wp-zg-meetup/blob/master/.github/talk-description-template.md) from the `.github` folder and name it like the branch in the step 2
5. Copy the renamed file to a directory of the meetup you're interested in talking at. For instance if you want to give a talk at #21 meetup, place it in `meetups/2019/meetup#21` folder (meetups are happening every two months)
6. Fill all the details from the template
7. Submit a PR

Once a PR is submitted there could be some comments, if all is well, PR will be merged and your talk will be scheduled for one of the next meetups :)

# Talks wishlist

If you don't want to give a talk, but would like some topic being talked about you can open an issue where you'll describe the topic in more detail.

Before opening the issue, go through the [list of issues](https://github.com/wpcroatia/wp-zg-meetup/issues) and see if there is a similar existing topic. If there is, just leave a thumb up üëçüèª instead of creating a new issue.
